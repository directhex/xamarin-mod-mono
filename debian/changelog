mod-mono (1.2.5-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Replaced build-dependency apache2-dev || apache2-threaded-dev with only
    apache2-threaded-dev.
    The buildds stopped to compile the source package, as AutoDepWait only
    honors the first package (like sbuild) while the conventional (old) way
    just tried to build it and installed apache2-threaded-dev automaticly.
  * Replaced apache2 binary dependency with apache2-mpm-worker, as the built
    module for threaded apache will not work with prefork apache.
  * Added Homepage, Vcs-Browser and Vcs-Svn fields to debian/control.
  * Added myself to Uploaders.
  * Removed Eduard Bloch and Pablo Fischer from Uploaders, as they haven't touch
    the package over 2 years anymore.
