TODO for mod-mono
-----------------

* Look for beta testers :)
	If you are a prospective beta tester, these are some of the things
	that should be tested:

	- Install on Apache 1.3 and Apache 2.2.
	- Systems with a single Apache host and a single mod_mono application.
	- Systems with multiple virtual hosts and multiple mod_mono
	  applications.
	- Userdir support -- allow people to install ASP.NET applications in
	  their public_html directory.
	- Test with different Apache 2.2 threading models.
	- How well does Apache 1.3/2.2 manage to reload its config with
	  mod_mono activated (for example, mod_python will sometimes result
	  in apache 2.0 freezing upon reload).
	- Installation alongside other Apache modules (php, mod_perl,
	  mod_python, ...).
	- Anything else you can think of, particularly related to the Debian
	  packaging. Of course, bugs in mod_mono itself are also welcome, and
	  they will be communicated upstream.
