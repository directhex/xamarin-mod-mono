* I need to find WHY the build process doesn't wants to create the .info and .conf files inside the libapache-mod-mono directory, URGENT.
* I also renamed the files to their package name (filename to filename.package)

See ya..

* I talked with Gonzalo and he told me that XSP is just a webserver. So a user can run any asp.net test without running the xsp webserver by just having mod_mono in apache, however, the only thing that is really needed is: mod-mono-server, in few words: a user can use xsp or apache (with mod_mono) to run asp.net samples, the only thing that is really needed for xsp or apache is: mod-mono-server.

See ya!
